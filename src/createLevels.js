Proxima Centauri, aka PC, is a red dwarf star that serves as the prison for the Alpha Centauri system.\n Once a being arrives in PC its identity is lost, and is given the name __alpha__\n\n We play as _alpha_, a falsely imprisoned centorian.\n alpha was accused of killing Bambi’s mother. Previous to _alpha_’s imprisonment _alpha_ and Walt Disney were lovers.\n When Walt discovered _alpha_ killed Bambi’s mother it was too much for him, he swore to never talk to alpha again. (Walt Disney was reincarnated as a centaurian after he was cryogenically frozen, which can be a side-effect of cryogenics).\n _alpha_ is on a mission to escape PC and tell Walt the truth and win his love back."
